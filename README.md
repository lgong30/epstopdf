# EPS2PDF

This is an exercise for bash programming. In this exercise, I wrote a bash shell script to automatically convert all eps files (in current folder, including all of its sub-folders) into pdf files. If you have not installed epstopdf, it will automatically install it and its dependencies.

## File Intro

1. `eps2pdf.sh`: bash script to convert eps to pdf
2. `generate_eps.py`: python script to generate some eps files
3. `README.md`: current file 
4. `requirements.txt`: requirements for running the python script.
3. All `eps` files (including eps in current folder and its sub-folders) are generated by the python script `generate_eps.py`, which will be used for testing the bash script. 

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/lgong30/epstopdf.git 
cd epstopdf
sudo chmod +x ./eps2pdf.sh
./eps2pdf.sh 
```


If you want to use the python script to generate the eps by yourself, then 

```
python pip install -r requirements.txt 
python generate_eps.py
```


## Notice
I have only tested this script under Mac OSX and ubuntu 16.04.
